UltraStar Deluxe is inspired by SingStarâ¢, a popular karaoke game for the PlaystationÂ®. However, unlike SingStarâ¢, UltraStar Deluxe allows you to create your own songs and sing them on your PC. You can also download thousands of songs from various online sources, or use the built-in song editor to make your own.
 
The game supports up to six players, who can use microphones or other input devices to sing along with the music. The game scores the players based on the pitch and rhythm of their singing, and displays their performance on the screen. You can choose from different game modes, such as solo, duet, party, or medley.
 
UltraStar Deluxe is not only fun, but also educational. It can help you improve your singing skills, learn new languages, or discover new music genres. You can also customize the game with different themes, backgrounds, avatars, or plugins.
 
If you want to experience the joy of karaoke on your PC, you can download UltraStar Deluxe for free from [https://usdx.eu/](https://usdx.eu/). You can also find more information about the game on its [GitHub page](https://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe/USDX), or join its [Spanish community](https://ultrastar-es.org/es).
